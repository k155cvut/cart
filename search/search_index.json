Your knowledge and skills acquired from previous lessons will be used when processing the task. Your mission will be to evaluate which slopes are prone to avalanches and possible threats to the surroundings. You are going to monitor the situation within one selected Czech national parc. An essential part, without which the work cannot be done, is the acquisition of data from publicly available sources and the subsequent modification of the data in the GIS environment so that you can perform future analysis with them. At the beginning, you will receive a package of input data containing all necessary. Based on the DEM, it will be your goal to process and evaluate which slopes are prone to avalanche danger. To evaluate an avalanche slope, you need to know slope inclination, elevation, wind speed, and land cover.</p> <p>Criteria indicating a dangerous hillside with avalanche hazard potencial:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Area in the highest third of assigned national parc</p> </li> <li> <p>Slope &gt; 30\u00b0</p> </li> <li> <p>CLC land cover code = 2.X.X or 3.X.X (except for 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3)</p> </li> <li> <p>Peaks in windier half of assigned national parc</p> </li> </ul> <p>Input Data Package includes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Digital elevation model (DEM)</p> </li> <li> <p>Wind speed measurement</p> </li> <li> <p>Corine Land Cover (CLC)</p> </li> <li> <p>Czechia protected land areas</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>\u201cA DEM is a raster representation of a continuous surface, usually referencing the surface of the earth. The accuracy of this data is determined primarily by the resolution (the distance between sample points).

Exploring Input Data</p> <p>First of all, it\u2019s always essential to start with exploring input data, understand the data types or browse the attribute tables for instance.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Czech DEM is a raster which stores values of height above sea level.</p> </li> <li> <p>Czech protected land areas is a polygon feature layer containing polygons of national parks, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Wind speed measurement is a point feature layer of measurement units in Czechia with average measured wind speed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Corine Land Cover is a classified raster including many land cover and land use classes.</p> </li> </ul> <p>2. Get Your Input Data Ready</p> <ul> <li> <p>Set K\u0159ov\u00e1k projection (EPSG: 5514)</p> </li> <li> <p>Use definition query to display assigned Czech national parc. Picture below is displaying Krkono\u0161e national parc using definition query; DEM in the background.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Use Extract by Mask tool to clip raster by assigned national parc polygon.</li> </ul> <p>3. Raster Analysis</p> <p>In the following step, a set of spatial analysis tools together with subsequent reclassification will be processed to calculate and classify elevation and slope (steepness). Later on, you will deal with reclassification of Corine Land Cover raster and finally, suitable interpolation method will be used to help you process wind speed data.</p> <ul> <li>Use Slope function to calculate the steepness. Use extracted raster by your national parc as an input raster. The output should be similar to following picture.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Use Reclassify tool to change the values in slope raster. Basically, you\u2019re interested in two categories: 0\u00b0\u201330\u00b0 and 30\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 so you can define new values: 0 and 1. Zero stands for \u201cdoesn\u2019t meet the criteria\u201d.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>Similarly you need to reclassify your extracted DEM to decide, which values are within the highest third of national parc. In Krkono\u0161e national parc, the highest third is indicated by violet color (see the picture below).</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li> <p>By this time, you should have two reclassified raster layers (elevation and slope). Now it\u2019s time to do the same with CORINE Land Cover data. Such raster reclassification might look a little bit sophisticated since you have to discover and use the land cover codes in the attribute table. The criteria in the assignment are clear enough so it is going to be an easy job anyway.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you were successful to reclassify three raster layers, you can move to wind speed feature layer. You\u2019ve processed only raster data so far. Since you need to use raster calculator in the very ending, your final outputs have to be raster layers, so it is necessary to \u201ctransform\u201d a point layer using some math into a raster (continuous surface).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>\u201cInterpolation predicts values for cells in a raster from a limited number of sample data points. It can be used to predict unknown values for any geographic point data, such as elevation, rainfall, chemical concentrations, and noise levels.\u201d (pro.arcgis.com)</p> <p>Resources:</p> <p>pro.arcgis.comUnderstanding interpolation analysis pro.arcgis.comAn introduction to interpolation methods pro.arcgis.comComparing interpolation methods</p> <ul> <li> <p>Using some of the links above, you can compare interpolation methods and choose the best one (or at least suitable) for point data. For this purpose, Inverse distance weighing (IDW) looks promising. Fill speed attribute as a Z field value and don\u2019t forget to define an Output cell size (should be consistent for all your raster layers).</p> </li> <li> <p>The output should be calculated for entire Czech Republic and clipped by national parc polygon subsequently (if you first clip than interpolate, your result won\u2019t be accurate)</p> </li> <li> <p>Afterwards, the last reclassification is ahead: you have to detect a windier part of assigned national parc</p> </li> </ul> <p>4. Combine the criteria and find out the result!</p> <p>Now is time for the best part of solution: combining the reclassified raster layers and finding out risky areas. All you need is to use Raster Calclulator and compile an appropriate algebraic expression. Your raster layers include only values of 0 and 1. As it\u2019s mentioned above, zero is against the criteria. The final question is, how to construct four values as an algebra expression so the resulting raster layer would consist of values 0 and 1 again and zero would stand for \u201csafe\u201d slopes? Zero will represent for example an area in windier part &amp; lower half of national parc or area in the highest third of national parc &amp; having land cover code 1.2.1.</p> <p></p> <p>Avalanche risk in national parc Krkono\u0161e is red-colored in the picture below. It is possible to make the final raster semi-transparent and set Czech orthophoto as a background map to better illustrate the result for instance.</p> <p></p> <p>Another approach could be represented by symbolizing different levels of avalanche risk, which can be reached if you change the expression in raster calculator. Instead of multiplying the values of four raster layers, you can simply sum them up. Output will consist of 5 different values: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Change raster symbology afterwards to indicate increasing avalanche risk according to the that values.</p>"},{"location":"practicals/practical8/","title":"Data sources, Web map services","text":""},{"location":"practicals/practical8/#natural-earth-data","title":"Natural Earth Data","text":"<p>Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales.

The maximum area size is 24,000,000 square km, or 1500 MB file size. It takes between 2-7 minutes to extract an area. The email field is required, you will be notified by email if your extract is ready for download. Please use a meaningfull name for the extract.</p> <p>https://extract.bbbike.org//BBBike</p> <p>How to use the BBBike extract service:</p> <p>\u2013 move the map to your desired location.</p> <p>\u2013 click to create the bounding box.</p> <p>\u2013 move or resize the bounding box, or add new points to the polygon.</p> <p>\u2013 select a Format, enter Your email address and Name of area to extract.</p> <p>\u2013 click the extract button. Wait for email notification and download the map. Done!</p>"},{"location":"practicals/practical8/#arcgis-online","title":"ArcGIS Online","text":"<p>There is a simple solution how to add various data when using ArcGIS Pro.

You will be performing some GIS skills, cartography and a bit of design.</p> <p>GIS workflow:</p> <p>1. Download spatial data (from OSM via BBBike): select bounding box around your alma matter (cca 2 sq mile), fill in format, name and mail and hit Extract. Download link will be sent to your mail address once the online extraction process is ready.</p> <p>2. Read and select data in ArcGIS Pro:  Apply Equal Earth projection in map properties. Import points.shp shapefile to your map. Explore attribute table, especially the field type. Find and select the point representing your university.</p> <p>3. Spatial analysis part 1: Once the point (your university) is selected, use Buffer geoprocessing tool to create a 1-mile buffer around this spot. The function will process only 1 buffer zone around the selected point if the selection is active.</p> <p>4. Attribute-driven selection: Perform Select by attributes to find points related to culture using type attribute (search for theatres, museums etc.). Select all features in at least 5 different culture categories and extract those data in your project geodatabase.</p> <p>5. Spatial analysis part 2: Use Clip tool to extract points (feature layer containing culture places only) within the 1-mile buffer zone.</p> <p>6. At this stage, you should have 1-mile buffer zone around your university containing points of interest related to culture. Any other features can be removed from the map.</p> <p>Cartography workflow:</p> <p>1. Find appropriate symbols to represent each culture type.</p> <p>2. Insert the A3 format layout (choose landscape or portrait orientation)</p> <p>3. In Map Properties set appropriate Reference scale and define clipping extent by 1-mile buffer.</p> <p>4. Finish the layout: insert map window, add title, subtitle, legend, and credits. Feel free to make it nice! You can see an inspiration for your output below.</p> <p></p>"}]}
